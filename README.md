## **Repository Structure**  

`01_RAG Introduction`  
   - **Beginner-friendly** introduction to RAG.  
   - Covers the **core concepts**: retrieval, augmentation, and response generation.  
   - Hands-on with simple RAG pipelines.  

`02_RAG Intermediate`  
   - Explores **real-world implementations** of RAG.  
   - **Semantic search** using embeddings and vector databases.  
   - Includes the **Palazon Global Database** for **document retrieval**.  

`03_RAG Advanced`  
   - Covers **optimizing RAG models** for efficiency and accuracy.  
   - **Fine-tuning embeddings, multi-document retrieval, and caching strategies**.  
   - Introduces **hybrid RAG (retrieval + summarization)**.  

`Palazon Global Database`  
   - **Used in 02_RAG Intermediate for Semantic Search**.  
   - Contains structured/unstructured text files for testing **vector retrieval**.
