    "## **Introduction to Routing**  \n",
    "Routing in AI systems refers to the process of directing user queries or data to the most appropriate resource, model, or database. It ensures that relevant information is accessed efficiently, improving the accuracy and effectiveness of AI applications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why is Routing Important?**  \n",
    "- Enhances **efficiency** by directing queries to the correct data source.  \n",
    "- Improves **accuracy** by ensuring the right model or prompt is used.  \n",
    "- Reduces **processing overhead** by avoiding unnecessary computations.  \n",
    "- Enables **scalability**, making AI systems more adaptable to diverse queries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Routing can be categorized into two primary types:  \n",
    "1. **Logical Routing** – Based on predefined rules and structured decision-making.  \n",
    "2. **Semantic Routing** – Based on the meaning (semantics) of the query using AI techniques like embeddings and similarity measures. "
