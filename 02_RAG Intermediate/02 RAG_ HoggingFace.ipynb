    "## **Semantic Search System Using Document Embeddings and Vector Databases**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Introduction:**\n",
    "In todayâ€™s world, the ability to efficiently search and retrieve relevant information from large document collections is crucial for businesses and organizations. Traditional keyword-based search systems often fall short when dealing with complex queries or when users are unsure of the exact terms to search for. This is where **semantic search** comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic search leverages **natural language processing (NLP)** and **machine learning** to understand the meaning behind words and phrases, enabling more accurate and context-aware retrieval of information. In this lecture, we will explore how to build a semantic search system using **document embeddings** and **vector databases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Concepts Covered:**\n",
    "1. **Document Embeddings**: Representing text as high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning.\n",
    "2. **Vector Databases**: Storing and querying embeddings efficiently for fast retrieval.\n",
    "3. **Visualizing Embeddings**: Using dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE to visualize high-dimensional data in 2D.\n"
